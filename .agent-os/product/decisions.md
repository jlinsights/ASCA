**ID:** DEC-001
**Status:** Accepted
**Category:** Product
**Stakeholders:** Product Owner, Development Team, Cultural Advisors

### Decision

ASCA is a comprehensive Korean Calligraphy Association platform focused on preserving and innovating traditional Eastern calligraphy through multi-language cultural exchange, professional portfolio management, and streamlined membership system. Target market includes calligraphy practitioners at all levels (General, Recommended, and Invited artists) and cultural institutions.

### Context

Traditional Korean calligraphy education lacks modern digital tools for skill assessment and global community building. The platform bridges the gap between traditional techniques and modern technology while maintaining cultural authenticity. With increasing global interest in Eastern arts and digital transformation of cultural institutions, there's a significant market opportunity.

### Alternatives Considered

1. **Basic Art Portfolio Website**
   - Pros: Simple to build, low maintenance, quick to market
   - Cons: Limited functionality, no AI features, poor community engagement

2. **Generic Learning Management System**
   - Pros: Existing frameworks, standard features, lower development cost
   - Cons: No cultural specificity, no AI analysis, limited customization

3. **Social Media Platform for Artists**
   - Pros: Built-in networking, content sharing, viral potential
   - Cons: No educational structure, no skill assessment, cultural authenticity concerns

### Rationale

Key factors in decision:
- **Cultural Authenticity:** Maintains traditional design elements while providing modern UX
- **Professional Focus:** Portfolio management system tailored for calligraphy artists
- **Community Building:** 3-tier membership system (General → Recommended → Invited) creates clear progression
- **Global Reach:** Multi-language support enables international expansion
- **Scalability:** Modern tech stack (Next.js, TypeScript, Drizzle ORM) supports growth

### Consequences

**Positive:**
- Unique market position combining tradition with innovation
- Scalable architecture supporting global expansion
- Strong technical foundation with TypeScript and modern frameworks
- Comprehensive feature set addressing all community needs
- Clear membership progression providing motivation for artists

**Negative:**
- Portfolio system requires continuous enhancement and maintenance
- Cultural sensitivity requirements increase development overhead
- Multi-language content management adds complexity
- Dual database architecture increases technical maintenance

   - Cons: More complex deployment, manual optimization, SEO challenges

2. **WordPress with Custom Plugins**

## 2025-01-15: Simplified 3-Tier Membership System

**ID:** DEC-004
**Status:** Accepted
**Category:** Product
**Stakeholders:** Product Owner, Community Manager, Artists

### Decision

Implement a streamlined 3-tier membership system: General Calligrapher (일반작가), Recommended Calligrapher (추천작가), and Invited Calligrapher (초대작가), removing the previous 6-tier system and AI-powered progression features.

### Context

The original 6-tier system was overly complex for the community size and created unnecessary barriers. A simplified 3-tier system provides clearer progression paths and better aligns with traditional Korean art association structures.

### Rationale

- **Traditional Alignment:** Matches established Korean art association patterns
- **Clear Progression:** General → Recommended → Invited provides obvious advancement

- **Reduced Complexity:** Simplifies administration and member management

### Consequences

**Positive:**
- Clearer understanding of membership levels
- Simplified administration and management
- Better alignment with cultural expectations
- Reduced technical complexity
- Focus on portfolio quality over automated metrics

**Negative:**
- Less granular progression tracking
- Manual evaluation required for tier advancement
- Potential subjectivity in advancement decisions
- Fewer intermediate achievement levels
