# Product Mission (Lite)

ASCA is a comprehensive Korean Calligraphy Association platform that helps traditional calligraphy practitioners and cultural organizations preserve and innovate Eastern calligraphy by providing multi-language cultural exchange, sophisticated membership management, and digital community tools.

ASCA serves calligraphy artists at all levels and cultural institutions who need digital tools for portfolio management and community building. Unlike basic art platforms, ASCA provides a streamlined 3-tier membership system (General → Recommended → Invited), professional portfolio features, and authentic traditional design elements with modern UX patterns, enabling global cultural preservation and innovation.
